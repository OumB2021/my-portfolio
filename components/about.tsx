        <p className="mt-4 text-center leading-relaxed text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          Hello! I'm <strong>Oumar Barry</strong>, a senior majoring in Computer
          Science at The City College of New York with a passion for full-stack
          web development.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-center leading-relaxed text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          Originally from the Ivory Coast, I moved to the United States seven
          years ago, bringing with me a rich background in graphic design and
          videoediting. For four years, I immersed myself in creating visual
          content like flyers, posters, and videos. While this work allowed me
          to express my creativity, I felt a desire to make my creations more
          interactive.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-center leading-relaxed text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          In 2016,<strong> I took my first online HTML </strong> class and
          immediately fell in love with the world of{" "}
          <strong>Web Development. </strong>This newfound passion led me to
          switch my focus to computer science, where I could blend my artistic
          skills with programming to build dynamic, user-centric web
          applications. Now, as I approach graduation, I'm excited to contribute
          to projects that bridge design and functionality. I'm continuously
          learning and exploring new technologies to create engaging and
          impactful digital experiences.
